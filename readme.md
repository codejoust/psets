Prime Number Programs
#####

All these programs use brute force to find the possible primes, or find
if a certain number is prime or composite by checking the inputs going
up.

The python problem set has a double loop, full recursion, and a loop and
recursion for the test case. Using the pypy python executable leads to a
much greater speed boost than the default python 2.7 or 3.1
interperters.

C wins the race for speed in this case, and Java is not far behind pypy.
